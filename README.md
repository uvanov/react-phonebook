# React Phonebook Application

![](https://i.imgur.com/czVeuG7.png)

I needed to so some work-example to show my skills. TodoList and TicTacToe it's too banally.
I think phonebook is more interesting.  

**You can see source code above, by this link you can go to demo.**

### A small TODO: 
- Possibility to open chat with contacts
- Handle user's try to call with some error-alert. 

I'm hope someday rework it with Redux :)
